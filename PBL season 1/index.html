  <h2>What is PBL?</h2>
  <p>
    Pune Baller League (PBL) Season 1 is a competitive draft-based football league 
    hosted in Pune featuring 16 teams. The league begins with a high-energy Draft Night, 
    where teams strategically select players, followed by a structured 3-day tournament.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    The final day concludes with a premium closing event from 3 PM to 11 PM, 
    with peak audience engagement expected from 6 PM onwards.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    PBL is not just a tournament — it is a sports entertainment property designed 
    to combine competition, branding, youth culture, and premium event experience.
